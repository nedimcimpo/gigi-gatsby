He does the most amazing UX UI design and his work is admired by so many of our clients. He is actually always super busy, not that you’d know that because no one has ever seen Benjamin stressed or heard him raise his voice. No task is hard for Benjo, unless you ask him to write something about himself! The reason he is part of Gigi’s School program is because he insisted on it (and we love him for it), so apart from working full time on Mistral’s projects, Benjamin dedicates his time to share his knowledge of HTML, CSS and UX UI design with you.
'At Gigi’s School of Coding we try not only teach the tricks of the programming trade, but also share with you the values we most cherish.
'Our Benjo is the embodiment of a true Mistral person, kind, caring, dedicated and excellent at his job.
