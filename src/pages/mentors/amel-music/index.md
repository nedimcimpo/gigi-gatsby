Everything you imagined a true developer should be, that’s him. And much more! Amel may look young, but he carries an enviable, over a decade long experience in designing and implementing systems that handles TB's of data and millions of transactions and he is eager to share that knowledge with you.
He is very passionate about IT, a “fresh out of the oven” father, enjoys hiking and traveling and has only one weakness: Lamb! Resisting lamb is the only task he fails at.
Amel has an awesome ability to connect many complex concepts into one clear example making everything easy to comprehend, especially best practices and design patterns that he will be talking about the most during the internship. Specific for him are also his epic sense of humor and never-ending optimism.
