Not your ordinary Project Manager. A person who likes to read, explore and make things run smoother. He doesn\'t like to hang out "na kafi" and waste time on gossip. Agile, management, crypto, entrepreneurship, and leadership are the topics that interest him the most.
"He will try to teach you not only the basic principles of agile and project management but the management in general, leadership, how teams work, how individuals work - well, how they should work.He will show you that it's totally OK to FAIL (First Attempt In Learning). He will try to broaden your vision and make you think. And you are very welcome to make him think. He loves to learn.
'And all that while having fun. A lot of fun. Seriously, a lot of fun. See you!\n
