As an ambitious and passionate beginner in the world of programming I started looking for an internship that would best suit me. Someone mentioned that there is an internship in Mistral (one of the top 3 IT companies in Sarajevo) and that is where it all changed for me. I’ve decided to apply, and lucky for me, they immediately recognized my potential.

From the first day of Gigi School of Coding my life changed totally. Working 8 hours per day in teams on real projects mentored by Gigi, who is probably the best mentor I’ve ever met, is what the internship was all about. I started to notice improvements on myself as a junior developer soon after, gained working habits, improved my whole personality, and how to respect others opinion as well as expressing my own.

Gigi uses a really interesting and motivating approach in explaining all the coding rules, best practices and tricks making it easy to learn fast. If you are stuck with an issue, you have over a 100 of Mistral’s employees willing to help you in any moment, no matter how simple your question is.

As an intern you already feel as a part of the company since you have all resources and advantages that other Mistral’s employees have, there is no difference. What else could you wish for? Your only duty is to learn, mingle with teammates, code, eat, sleep and repeat!
