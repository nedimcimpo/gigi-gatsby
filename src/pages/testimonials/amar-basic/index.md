Gigi school of coding gave me a much needed opportunity to apply everything I’ve learned during my studies. It was a whole new dimension for me. We did have intro (theory)l classes, but we’ve started working on Mistral mock projects very soon after the beginning of the internship. It is truly fascinating how fast you learn when you take on a project head on, 8 hours a day, all week with a great team. The working environment and all the mentors were excellent. Mistral’s internship taught me how to organize time, manage a team and understand the complete process of software development. It is not all just about learning, there are also team buildings, mistral brunches, lunch and learns, games room, etc. I also had a chance to meet the talented people working at Mistral who are always ready to help. The whole time of my internship I felt like I was already an employee as we had the same treatment, challenging projects and all the benefits! I strongly recommend everyone with a passion for software development to apply.
