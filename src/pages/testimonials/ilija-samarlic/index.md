You're here reading this, means you are showing initiative. That's good, keep it up.

"Learn to code" is the latest buzz in the world and everybody wants to give it a try and get involved. Can you learn it on your own? Yes, although I am sure you heard it before if you want to go fast (short distance), go alone. If you want to go far, go together.

So why join Gigi School of Coding? It's simple, Gigi School of Coding will let you see and experience the whole development process and give you an awesome team to do it with.

You'll be surrounded by beautiful minds and some amazing people who will guide you and give valuable feedback so you can track and manage your progress.

Some of the things you'll learn involve the laying down of sound and firm grounds to build your software product (application) on, using different programming paradigms, proven practices, various tools and frameworks.

You will also come to realize just how important the testing process (QA) is, and how to style your apps to be more distinctive, user friendly and intuitive (UX/UI). Interestingly you'll be exposed to concepts of agile mindset, something, once embraced, will help you add value to your coding endeavours.

Mistral’s internship also provides you with an opportunity to hone your English communication skills or to break that barrier of using foreign language.

Learning to code takes A LOT of time and effort, so if you are ready to be ALL in, I suggest you try your odds and apply.
