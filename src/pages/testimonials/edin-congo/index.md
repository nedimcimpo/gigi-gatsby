Before I got enrolled at Gigi School of Coding, I quit my previous job in order to pursue this new challenge.

I can thank Muamer Č. (Project Manager at Mistral) for the life changing advice he gave me. This was a little shock for me and my family as I wasn’t sure if I was ready for the challenges of software development due to the lack of experience. I needed some kind of tutoring to sharpen my skills, something I knew I’d find at Mistral’s ‘Gigi School of Coding’. That internship was a big crossroad for me.

You must be aware that Gigi School of Coding is not magical; you won’t progress from just physically being present. You have to work hard, invest in yourself and pursue your goals.

What sets Mistral apart from others is that you will get next level support in that pursuit, starting with Gigi himself; sharing his decades worth of knowledge. The rest of the mentors also give their 100% to help sharpen your skills in the domains they’re most experienced in.
I like how Mistral’s Human Potential team makes you feel like you’ve always been a part of the team and how an army of others assure you that you belong right there, from day one, by being open, kind and friendly.

Gigi School of Coding is a one of a kind opportunity to learn from the best, acquire new knowledge every day and strive for excellence, gaining the qualities Mistral is all about. Alongside chocolate, laughter and games, of course.
