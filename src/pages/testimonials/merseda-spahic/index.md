Gigi School of Coding dramatically improved my knowledge of C# and SQL among other things, and gave me a chance to experience the real IT dynamic atmosphere everyone is buzzing about! A fantastic team of likeminded individuals in Mistral helped me realize I was on the right career path.
'During the internship, Gigi interns (now my dear friends and colleagues) were separated into teams of 3 or 4. Every two weeks we had to present our work (demo).

Maybe this sounds scary for some, like it was for me, but sooner or later everyone will be in that situation, so it is better to get rid of fear of public speaking by practising it from the very start.

 All the projects at Gigi School of Coding were a real deal, so switching to a real Mistral project afterwards was pretty easy.
Mistral mentors and others colleagues from the company were extremely helpful and happy to provide suggestions and guidance. My university studies gave me a good foundation, and prepared me for various challenges, but we are all aware that we are like uncut diamonds in need for polishing in order to shine.

If you are ready to show what you're made of and shine, I suggest you apply for Gigi School of Coding and begin a new, advanced chapter of your life.
