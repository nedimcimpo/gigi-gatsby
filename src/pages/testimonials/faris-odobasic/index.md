Working with the “latest trend” technologies was possible only in my spare time while I was a student at the University. The IT market simply develops too fast, making  it hard for Universities to keep up with their curriculums. Learning independently is definitely a must no matter what University you go to, but it’s not that easy. Practicing AngularJS, for example, on my own, wasn’t that successful. I knew I needed a mentor, and a team. That is why I applied to Mistral for an internship. Thanks to Gigi’s approach in Gigi School of Coding, I have managed to progress faster than I had ever hoped for.

What fascinated me the most is the fact that over a 100 engineers at Mistral were open to all of my enquiries. They even asked follow up questions about how helpful was their suggestion or solution and if I understood it fully.

I loved their vibe and the whole Mistral community. You can only imagine how happy I was when they hired me after the internship, making me a part of their extraordinary team officially. I have to admit that I worked harder than ever to get that opportunity.

The only thing I was sceptical about in the beginning was when I found out that internship is like 3 months and full-time: “5 days a week, 8 hours of work”.” I asked myself: “Can I manage a full-time internship with my college obligations?”, “Who can sit 8 hours and code??” - and many other (silly) questions.

They were all answered after only one week spent at Gigi School of Coding. With a professional teaching ensemble, relaxed, home- like atmosphere in Mistral, many team buildings, hanging out over in-house gaming sessions, those “long” 3 months were over before I knew it. And yes, It was all worth it!
