When it comes to wishes, everything is allowed and no one can stop you from having dreams and working hard to make them come true. I am a living proof of that. I really wanted to be a part of an IT company where engineers create amazing solutions through various interesting projects.For someone like me, who has background in aviation industry, it seemed impossible to get involved in such an unfamiliar world, but I decided not to stop dreaming and making steps towards making my dreams come true.I applied for Gigi School of Coding just to see what is it what's in there in IT industry that every IT engineer is passionate about, and to test if this was really the world that I wanted to be a part of. The answer came soon. Just after a couple of days of participation on a Gigi project. Although we had a great mentor – Gigi, who unselfishly shared his knowledge, my true motivation and interest started exponentially raising during Quality Assurance lessons held by my present colleague Sumejja. I discovered my passion about improving the quality of software solutions. Testing,tracking everything and suggesting enhancements became a part of my life in which I truly enjoy. Changing my career path was a huge challenge for me, but also a great example and motivation for anyone who wants to join the IT world.
