After faculty, the first thing that comes to your mind is “I need to find a job”. That is when all the self doubt kicks in: Do I have what it takes? Is my current skillset sufficient? Will I ever be good enough?

I knew one thing though. I was done with all the theory and sleepless nights over a book. I wanted a real project and a real team. Gigi School of Coding offered exactly that. This internship at Mistral is an actual simulation of the real deal.

We worked on a project from start to finish, and learned everything you need for web development and more. Depends what you show most interest in. My favorite part was all the experience and knowledge sharing. I never thought I could learn so much for such a short period of 3 months. Mentors did an amazing job showing us how we can make the Web a better place and helping us grow as individuals in every way.

During faculty my main subject was back-end development, but that changed in Gigi School of Coding. I got completely hooked on front-end development in Angular and really enjoyed learning it.

The internship covered every bit of the software development process, from the basics like standups meetings (Agile methodology) to UX/UI flows and QA tests! Gaining working habits during the internship was also a big plus for me. Gigi School of Coding made a big difference in my life and I recommend it to anyone who wants a career in the dynamic world of IT
